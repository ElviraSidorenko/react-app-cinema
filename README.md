# Tongariro Cinemas Website

Welcome to the repository for the Tongariro Cinemas Website. This project aims to provide an engaging and informative online presence for Tongariro Cinemas, showcasing current movies, showtimes, and upcoming releases. Please note that this project is currently a front-end only implementation, developed with React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer to use `npm` (Node Package Manager).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Limitations
No Backend Functionality: Please note that as of now, the website does not have backend functionality implemented. This means features such as booking tickets through the booking page or sending messages through the contact page are not available.
